Sensational and almost impossible to find in its original edition Original Soundtrack for the documentary composed by Perigeo's bassist Giovanni Tommaso (Living in Tokyo: City of Heaven), very active and prolific in writing Library music during the '70s. This extraordinary Score was composed to be the soundtrack for a documentary focused on Tokyo city and his inhabitants, where Giovanni Tommaso added some typical elements of melodic/harmonic Japanese music and meltied them with a kind of 'Urban' music along the line of a Jazz-Rock style he would later encode in Perigeo project. Silvano Chimenti, Antonello Vannucchi and Gegè Munari are the uncredited artists who played in this session. Outstanding oriental Prog. Rock tunes are featured here and contributed to make this lost gem also sought-after by Progressive collectors.

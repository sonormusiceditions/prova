This incredible record has almost everything, and explains why it's so highly regarded and sought-after. Legendary album among Italian Library junkies and euro groove hunters by the great maestro and orchestra conductor Puccio Roelens, responsible of some of the Funkiest productions made in Italy. Music swings from Jazz to Funk and Psichedelia, with loads of terrific beats, laden grooves and top breakbeats simply to die for. Breathtaking classy Psychedelic Jazz arrangements, Lounge Funk tunes and also Bossa themes played by some of the finest Italian session men of the period all spiced with terrific drums groove. One of the most desired items of the genre is finally available for the Record Store Day 2017.

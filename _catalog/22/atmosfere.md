Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

One of the darkest and in high-demand Italian Library. From the infamous Fonit 7001 series here's the most obscure and deepest Rino de Filippi's creation composed along with maestro Giancarlo Chiaramello, very elusive LP. Obstinated Dark Breakbeats like in the killer "OSTINAZIONE" with Fuzz Psychedelic guitar and amazing drumming tempo. More dark samples on "PULSAZIONI". Spookiest guitar and basslines ever and scary atmospherics with screaming sophisticated vocals too. Insane record!

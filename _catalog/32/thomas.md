Italian Soundtrack milestone and pure masterpiece of Italian Giallo Thriller exploitation. Infamous, legendary Score for the film directed by cult italian director Pupi Avati and originally released on Gemelli label in 1970. Mindblowing scary Giallo vibes / stunning cinematic sinister beats with the participation of Edda Dell'Orso who gives some astonishing frightful vocals / dope thrilling vibes allover. THOMAS aka THOMAS E GLI INDEMONIATI is an Horror/Thriller/Fantasy/Drama/Grotesque film cult from 1969, originally not distributed due to the bankrupt of film publisher. Mythical item for record collectors and foundamental piece for any italian Giallo/Thriller enthusiast.

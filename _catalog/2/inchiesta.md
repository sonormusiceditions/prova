Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Seriously wicked and really hard to find in its original edition, this superb sound Library brings the mark of the great, eclectic maestro Alessandro Alessandroni. The songs on this LP were originally composed for the broadcast of eight episodes made by RAI italian TV called "OPEN WINDOW". Many mid '70s Jazz-Funk/Scat themes full of samples, breaks and Funky tunes. Merged in this record you'll find heavy Funk-Drama tracks devoted to 1970s Poliziottesco's grooves interfering with slow Lounge Funk arrangements feat. sweet Scat vocals. Great brass, a sure winner!

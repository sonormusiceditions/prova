Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Released around mid '70s, this scarce Italian Library composed by maestro Oscar Rocchi was released on the same Fonovideo label of the infamous Giancarlo Barigozzi's WOMAN'S COLOURS, who also probably played in this session. This is one of the finest Funk Breaks even Jazz-Funk samples from the Italian Library circle, with terrific drums breaks, stoned flute, Fuzzy guitars and Fender Rhodes solos. Many tracks here are perfect Bboy samples, and have chipped in to make this LP just legendary. Huge session for a very solid album from the beginning to the end.

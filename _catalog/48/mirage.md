Absolute mythical Italian Library LP out of the rad New Tape micro-label vaults - "MIRAGE" is an album signed by SCOEN aka Enzo Scoppa and actually composed and arranged by Francesco Cicci Santucci, originally released in 1971 on 100 copies only. Dreamy collectors item and super obscure gem, this outstanding LP is another must-have jewel from the unlimited Italian Music Library production of the '70s and easily one of the top of this game. What we have is mental Jazz-Funk beats with fat basslines and killer drum breaks, bewitching Exotica groove and dope Lounge moods, all driven by a solid groovy key for the whole album. Another monster Italian Library is just filed!

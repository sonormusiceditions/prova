Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Absolutely one of the best Oscar Rocchi's Italian Jazz pianist Library LP. Also released on Music Scene label under the title "JUNGLE BIRDS" with same matrix number stamped on dead wax. Just incredible and totally killer Jazz-Funk vibes with an outstanding Tullio de Piscopo drumming sessions to die for. Oscar Rocchi at Fender Rhodes and organ accompained by his strict collegue Giancarlo Barigozzi on flute and Sax Soprano. Fantastic and complete album, features the best Jazz-Funk, Funky and Jazzy Breaks samples on side A and stellar Experimental Avantgarde Jazz sounds on side B. Psychedelic and Moody, beatiful as much as RARE in its original edition. Some tracks were used in 1972 and 1973 as Soundtracks for Italian TV shows theme songs.

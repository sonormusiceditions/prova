We're proud to announce the reissue of one of the true rarities of Italian discography out there and an absolute grail of Italian Film music. Originally released in 1968 on the legendary RCA Italiana SP 8000 series (promo-only) on only 100 copies, here's an Impossible jewel by maestro Piero Umiliani that contains various themes from original scores of the '60s - "IL COMANDANTE", "EXTRACONIUGALE", "TUTTO IL BELLO DELL'UOMO", "LA BELLA DI LODI", "CONTROSESSO", "LA CELESTINA P.R...". Carefully remastered from the original RCA master tapes and released with heavy cardboard sleeve like the original press. Legendary Italian OST LP!

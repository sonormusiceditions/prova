Another insane and fuzzy Italian Library killer from 1971 - Nello Ciangherotti aka Nenty & Silvano Chimenti "SONORITA' NEL LAVORO", originally out of the vaults of Globe Records. A top-notch set of sleazy Psych, dope Progressive riffs and Experimental Rock themed music produced to score some obscure documentaries about world of work. Mad section of evil Psychedelic guitars and fuzzy Wah Wah by the great guitarist Silvano Chimenti (the man behind 'Droga' and further Library grails) and studio arrangements by maestro and orchestra director Nello Ciangherotti. Stunning edgy vibes with loads of hand-made sonorities that recall sounds of industry, mechanical instruments and smoking chimneys for a dope Psychedelic winner. Limited to 300 copies only!

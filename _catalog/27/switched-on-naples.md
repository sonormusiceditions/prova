We're so glad and proud to announce the reissue of a very underrated Piero Umiliani's masterpiece. "SWITCHED ON NAPLES", originally released in 1972 on ‎OmiCron‬ LP 0023, is an outstanding ‪‎Library‬ with pure touch of genius: Maestro Umiliani revisits Naples popular songs in Electronic way by the use of synthesizer. The record is entirely carried out with Electronic sounds. From the back cover liner noters: "For the first time in the history of Electronic music, these sounds produced by the synthesizer lose their science fiction appearence to aquire a fully Italian flavour, where the folkloristic component often joints the "grimace", the "character" and the unconventional wit, typical of Neapolitans". Truly recommended album!

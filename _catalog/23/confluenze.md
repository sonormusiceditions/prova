Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Italian Free Jazz milestone. Here's Franco Tonani (NIGHT IN FONORAMA, drums set of WHAT'S HAPPENING by Azzolini ecc.) at the drums together with top Italian Jazz musicians of the time for a full Free Jazz/Avant-garde session. Tracks like "SHEPPING", "ODD PIECE" and "WHISPER" are high-class bopping Jazz cues with Tonani killing at the drums. Other weird and Avantgarde themes on both of the sides. Legendary italian Jazz LP!

Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 400 copies.

Originally released on Ayna Records in 1972 and never came around, co-produced with Italian library collector Andrea Galtieri (Cavalier Piscopo). Pinnacle of the rarest Macchi's albums, released as private pressing, just 1 copy it's known to float around. Super rad percussive music, Minimal as much as Experimental, it was released for an obscure documentary of late '70s. Remastered from Macchi's personal master tapes.

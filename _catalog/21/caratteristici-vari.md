Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Italian FUNKY Library MONSTER from the infamous Fonit Usignolo series. This insane album contains many outtakes from the "INCHIESTA" jam we reissued in 2013, so it's probably fully recorded in 1977 and not 1979 as dated on original pressing. "FOGGY PLACE" easily explains why this album is on TOP levels, Hip Hop Funky with Scat vocals. 20 tracks of several Score and various themes, Jazz-Funk and Funky vibes all over, Fender Rhodes and Sexy Scat vocals, Bossa, Easy Listening, Blues Jazz, Hammond Funk, tense cinematic and lively groovy vibes for the full album. KILLER!

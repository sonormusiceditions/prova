Italian Soundtrack holy grail and one of the most regarded scores by the majestic Oscar Award maestro Luis Bacalov, author of DJANGO, IL POSTINO (The Postman) and other legendary film scores. Original soundtrack for the Drama/Erotic film directed by Fernando Di Leo, shooted in our beatiful Sicily, IT. For us, totally destroys all his Soundtrack productions with a big orchestra selection featuring some of the best Italian grooves ever - terrific Funk beats, mindmelting scats, Brazilian influenced music with loads of dope Exotic vibes. The thing is a swaggering waltz of Funk with Wah Wah guitars, sensous horns, huge orchestra arrangements, smooth rhythms throughout with deep vocals by studio combo session, and finally the heaviest driving piano groove ever. A gigantic Italian music masterpiece finally available for the joy of collectors!

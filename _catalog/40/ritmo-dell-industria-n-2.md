Sonor Music Editions proudly presents an absolute Italian mood music grail and one of the best Library Music recordings ever - ALESSANDRONI's RITMO DELL'INDUSTRIA n.2, a true legend in the field. This is the maestro most prized and sought-after album, produced in 1969 on the small Grand Prix label, part of the Leonardi publishing group. A mindmelting record featuring some of the most killer driven beats ever! - dark vibes and haunting atmospheres with constant and moody Industrial rhythms, filled with tons of drum breaks, trippy Scat vocals and eastern inspired obsessive grooves. Music has been remastered from the original stereo master tape and the back sleeve will feature deluxe liner notes written by Mr. Jonny Trunk. Limited edition 500 copies worldwide. HOLY GRAIL ALERT!

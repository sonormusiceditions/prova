Original soundtrack for the erotic thriller movie from 1976 directed by Massimo Pirri. Outstanding and 100% essential Italian OST containing top-notch Giallo and sleazy thrilling music with dark, fuzzy, funky and definitively trippy sounds that put this amazing soundtrack on high demand. Euro Sex movie themes & arrangements with the classic Italian Giallo sound of the time filled with funky drums & breaks dopeness, spaced-out downtempo beats and hypnotic basslines / dark orchestrations with threatening bells and swirling, filtered-out Hammond organ / sinister female chorus / fuzzy cues and captivating Psychedelic moods / ringing thriller vibes and dramatic moments / menacing Progressive riffs / sleazy wah-wah, heavy piano and sweeping strings. For fans of Nicolai / Morricone Giallo and Thriller cults. Terrific ITALIAN OST!

Music has been remastered from the original master tapes using the original tape cuts as source. The Bonus CD included features more outtakes from the original recording sessions.

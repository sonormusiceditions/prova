Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies. Includes a never seen A3 poster.

Originally released on 'cult' Pegaso promotional label, "THE MAN WITH ICY EYES" soundtrack was pressed on very few copies like all Pegaso editions 'out of commerce', becoming a truly sought-after gem among Record Collectors of the genre. Trombonist and arranger Giuseppe De Luca, who died shortly after, wrote this magnificent score in 1971, ripping off the main theme from "Lady In Cement" by Hugo Montenegro from the same year. The high music in here is played by the MARC 4 (Maurizio Majorana on bass, Carlo Pes on guitar, Antonello Vannucchi organ) feat. Giuseppe De Luca at trumpet and Vincenzo Restuccia at drums. Magnificent vocals by the best scatting queen Edda Dell'Orso and chorus by I Cantori Moderni Di Alessandroni. KILLER!

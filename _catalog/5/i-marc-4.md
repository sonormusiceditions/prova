Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Crazy RARE in demand soundtrack LP originally released on the highly sought-after promotional label "PEGASO" Edizioni Musicali. Music by Maestro Carlo Pes here, the "C" guitarist from the infamous quartet I MARC 4 which also probably plays on this session. The amazing Jazz-Funk track "Tough Guy" is the main theme of the record and it's delivered in 3 different versions. Crazy tunes like the tensed dramatic "Morte di un Hippie", the great Lounge track "Relaxing in New Mexico" with nice Hammond improvisations, guitar and flute, and "Murder On The Set", fantastic cinematic Score; Bossa-Jazz on "Joinin' the Swimming Pool" with some nice piano among the others. Top record, not to be missed!

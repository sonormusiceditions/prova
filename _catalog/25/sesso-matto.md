Italian legendary OST! - One of the Armando Trovajoli's famoust masterpieces. Original Soundtrack for the Italian cult Sexy comedy starring the sex-symbol Laura Antonelli and Giancarlo Giannini. Originally filmed in several episodes, directed by Dino Risi; afterwards reissued in France and Japan. Huge and lovely Score mainly characterized by the main theme 'SESSOMATTO', a killer famed theme which was originally a sample of Manu Dibango Latin Funk hit "Soul Makossa" with its stunning Funk Breakbeats terrifically rearranged by maestro Trovajoli. We reissued the original pressing featuring the 1st cutting of SESSOMATTO theme with the deleted Armando Trovajoli's Hammond solo. Enjoy it!

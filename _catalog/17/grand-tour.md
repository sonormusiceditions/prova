Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

KILLER Italian Library LP from the Fabio Fabor's Edizioni Musicali MINSTREL - RING label, music by Carlo Savina and his orchestra. Shocking and still underrated Electronic panoramic Lounge sounds spaced out by Jazz-Funk and dope Funk Breaks, amazing Electronic Underwater effects. Music inspired by sea islands for a total Lounge aquatic trip. Stunning bassline opens "CANARIES", the best shot from this album: Piano Fender on slow drum breaks, infectious acustic guitars. Electronic/Synthesizer central solo, mental Breaks!

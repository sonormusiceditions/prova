Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies. 

A totally INSANE italian Killer Library LP reissued for the joy of collectors and sample hunters from the highly-collectible Fonit Usignolo series. Famed Mario Molino's album for the MENTAL Breakbeats hailing from the track "TRAFFICO CAOTICO", a simply mindmelting Electronic Hip Hop Beat which seems to be written nowadays. Spaced-out deep Electronic and Experimental sounds with another atomic shot "ICELAND BOSSA" featured. More Avantgarde, TV-Score themes, Industrial vibes and Space Electronics madness on the rest of the album. TOP Molino recording can buy!

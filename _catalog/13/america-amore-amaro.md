Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

One of the most elusive Italian Library records on the "Edi-Pan" label. An inspired musical interpretation of mid '70s young America with spacey Funk/Breaks and strung-out Italian sounds of the period. Woah! 

What we have here is a Remigio Ducros and Luciano Simoncini (Arawak, Jason Black, etc) sure shot. Fantastic record for those who are into the classic Simoncini/Ducros sound. Very reminiscent of the "Accadde A.." and Jason Black recordings. What you can expect are tightly knitted and compressed drums, stoned flute sections, shouting horns, Fender Rhodes Piano, heavy basslines and that signature spacey Wah Wah guitar that's on all of the earlier Simoncini recordings. As with many of the Ducros and Simoncini recordings, it seems to be a geographical tour of America, and shows their take on American culture at the time. Variations on the Sgambetto - Sgambata theme / stoned "Accadde A.." flute / Hip-Hop beats / 'popping' percussion / Fender bass / rhodes e-piano etc. Daniela Casa is probably the girl playing all the Wah Wah and cosmic Fuzz distortions. Great samples for producers and DJs, top LP!

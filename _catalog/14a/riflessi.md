Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Previously published in 1973 on Smash label with different title and tracklist, we got a slick, stand-out Italian Library LP for your delectation. Choc-a-block full of summery, keyboard-laden moods and grooves. 

Incredible and superb LP with a great different artwork, the "Farfalla" so famous subject in Library sleeves. The entire record features stunning super Moody Downtempo Funk accompained by groovy Electronics made through Synthesizer. Lounge Breaks tinged by Prog. music themes. A totally MUST-HAVE!

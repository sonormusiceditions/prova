Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Track B7 previously unreleased on vinyl.

Amazing Funk Library LP featuring tones of Jazz-Funk and Psychedelic beats. The listener is constantly kept guessing as the music swings between Psych Funk, Esoteric Jazz and Cinematic/Love Themes then back again. Tracks like "Love For Sale", "Privacy", "Metropolis Notte" and "Dopping 2000" are simply timeless and go a long way to explaining why Cometa albums are so highly regarded. Sounds in here perfectly plunge in the universe of great 1970s music.

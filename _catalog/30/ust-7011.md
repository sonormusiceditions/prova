Another legendary jam on Fonit Library series 'Hi-Fi International' composed by maestro Stelvio Cipriani. Probably written for some obscure movie, this infamous session from 1976 recently discovered immediately became a grail for DJs and collectors. Outstanding Score vibes, several Western and Romantic movie themes in the vein of Ennio Morricone are alternated by some insane beats and spacey Avant-garde. The mindmelting groove of "NOTTE DELLE STREGHE" is an incredible Experimental arrangement of 'In A Gadda Vida' notes with a killer esoteric style and true top notch stuff for any samples hunter. Fantastic ITALIAN LIBRARY LP, impossible to find on its original edition!

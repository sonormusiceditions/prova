Welcome to the king of Underwater Italian Libraries. This is Fabio "Fabor" Borgazzi AQUARIUM, totally amazing Underwater Modal Jazz & Lounge album with loads of vintage Electronic keyboards, marine echoes, whirling organs, weird Undewater synthesizers, Jazzy drumming and so on... This record is clearly one Holy Grail, a bunch of Lascivious tracks wich semplicity let the listeners enjoyment idea grow out so smoothly that after many delightful replay we take it like a Perfect Masterpiece.

Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

Yet another jewel re-released by us, originally coming from 'cult' soundtracks Pegaso label promo-only. This score was written in 1972 for the Giallo Thriller film directed by Tulio Demicheli starring George Hilton / Luciana Paluzzi and Anita Strindberg. Sleazy Psychedelic and Lounge masterpiece featuring sinister and Thrilling themes. Fine and intense atmospheres accompanied by magnificent female bewitching Edda Dell'Orso's vocals, harpsichord & glistening e-piano vamps, phased flute and amazing cinematic Beats and Breaks. Fantastic OST!

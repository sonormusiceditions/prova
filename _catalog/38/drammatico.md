An absolute Italian Library HOLY GRAIL and maybe the most desired item of the genre, originally released in early '70s on the hot Panda Records - a totally insane Library album conceived by maestro Alessandro Alessandroni and Giuliano Sorgini under their pseudonyms Braen & Raskovich and surely their highest point of collaboration. Concept album where the music is just out-of-this-world and way ahead of its time, nothing to be compared with! - War and dramatic themed music ranging from the most evil Electronics to dark Fuzz distortions and huge Hip Hop beats all driven by a mental Psychedelic madness. A record coming from hell and unbelievable session we've been lucky to remaster from the original master tapes. Enjoy the trip!

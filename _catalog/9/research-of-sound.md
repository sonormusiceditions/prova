Comes on 180gr. vinyl with improved sound quality. Limited Edition 500 copies.

From start to finish this album features the most insane Jazz-Funk tunes ever released on a Library LP from Italy. Amleto Armando aka 'Puccio' Roelens was a great and requested composer and arranger of the time, been working for Rai and Vedette Records and being also and orchestra leader and pianist. Along with "ROCK SATELLITE" this a KILLER Funk record all the way through, and the most similar record to mythical Torossi's FEELINGS. Incredible B-boy drum breaks in this session with spacey Fender Rhodes, cosmic Synth, mad Fuzz and treated Wha-Wha, heavy basslines, and huge horns section where Dino Piana Jazz trombone seems to play and so on...

Historical Italian Jazz session originally released on legendary vinyl LP from 1973. Outstanding and magnificent Jazz Funk jewel and first album ever by this killer combo led by Dino Piana & Oscar Valdambrini. An original Jazz Library recording used for the soundtrack of Rai TV programme "SERATA AL GATTO NERO", 1973. Top Italian groovy Jazz and mental album, easily a grail of the genre featuring some terrific breaks, killer Wah Wah guitar and Funky Hammond job, with a solid backing studio orchestra. Loads of laden stylish grooves with brilliant Modal Jazz numbers, smoothy vibes, and Cool Jazz influences with also different musical themes. Every track is just heaven with several hot club tunes for DJs. Solid masterpiece!

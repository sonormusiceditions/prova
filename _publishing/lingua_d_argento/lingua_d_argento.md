Stunning Italian soundtrack originally issued in 1976 which is widely considered a true holy grail of the genre and Funk Exotica masterpiece. Originally composed by maestro and orchestra conductor Alberto Baldan Bembo for the movie soundtrack "Ecco lingua d'argento", starring the sexy Carmen Villani. The album includes many spellbinding and powerful grooves filled with great basslines, dope wah wah and killer Funky sounds; a countless amount of drum beats with dancing Fender Rhodes, Disco-Funk arrangements with driving tropical percussions, dreamy cinematic strings and sexy female chorus harmonize. Top-notch stuff for any crate digger / groove hunter / beat maker / record collector and vintage music vinyl maniac out there. Incredible session, pinnacle of maestro Bembo production and a real masterpiece from the beginning to the end!

# ABOUT US

Founded in 2013 and based in Rome, in the heart of Italy, SONOR MUSIC EDITIONS is specialized in synchronization music for films, radio and television. We spread rare and obscure Funk, Jazz, Breakbeats, Cinematic Lounge, Psychedelic and Progressive music, Spacey Cosmic Sounds, Easy Listening and all that good vintage Italian vibes hailing from Library and Soundtrack music productions. The label's name comes from the Italian proper translation of ‘Library Music’, which is 'Sonorizzazioni'.
Hence the name Sonor Music.
